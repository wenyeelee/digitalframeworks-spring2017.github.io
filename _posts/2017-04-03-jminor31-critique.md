I chose to analyze Five Thirty Eight's article called "Tony Romo Was A Good QB In An Era Of Great Ones." I broke down this article into three main categories: News worthiness, relevancy of information and ability to communicate.

First off, considering that just last week news broke that Tony Romo would be trading his helmet for a reporter’s microphone, this article was news worthy. When an athlete goes from the face of sport’s biggest brand to ending his career on a sour note, the natural thing to do is to analyze his career. The question? Was he good or was he great?

This article attempts to answer that question. This brings me to my next point: relevancy of information. I thought it was smart to draw comparison to other great quarterbacks such as Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Carson Palmer. However, in drawing that comparison, I can’t understand why the author chose *career* passing yards as party of his analysis. For a guy like Romo, who has been hurt with injuries for over half his career, comparing him to competitors that have remained healthy is unfair. Career passing yards is irrelevant. What is relevant, however, is taking Romo’s best year and seeing where his competitors stood next to him. The author should have focused on a particular year, not his entire career. How did Romo compare when his team was in the run for a championship? How did he line up against other great quarterbacks in a game-by-game analysis? I believe answering *these* questions would have made a much stronger piece.

Finally, there is the ability to communicate. Personally, I feel sometimes numbers can get lost in translation when telling a story. In this case, I think the author did an impeccable job of using standard statistics that any sports fan would understand. However, I think it is prudent to pick one statistic to highlight the most important information instead of showing them all just to be scrolled over. I believe the author could’ve taken a much deeper analysis in the NFL pass efficiency rating he pointed out. Why pick that statistic? Russell Wilson and Cam Newton will go down as some of the greats to ever play, but yet they love to run the ball instead of pass.

While this article is simple, concise and straightforward, the intrigue is lacking. With a deeper analysis and the right use of statistics this could’ve been an A. It currently stands as a C- on Jasmine’s radar of data journalism.
